## Would you like me to proceed with creating implementation tasks for each of these items? Each task would focus on making the system behave like a real organization, with natural department interactions and resource sharing.

## ME:
> yes, we need to rehaul the fix checklist to reflect the last two responses you gave me. then each task in the checklist needs a structed plan of implementation, that compliments and builds on the current GLUE structure, and aligns the framework with these concepts

# Implementation:

## Here's the updated Fix Checklist with implementation plans that align with GLUE's current structure:

Fix Checklist (Comprehensive Update)

        3. Team Context: {team_context}
        4. Next Steps: {steps}
        """
    

    async def process(self, prompt: str):
        # Think like a real team member
        thought = self._analyze_task(prompt)
        
        # Consider available tools
        if needed_tools := self._identify_tool_needs(thought):
