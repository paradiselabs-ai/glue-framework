# GLUE Best Practices Guide

## Overview

This guide provides best practices and patterns for building effective GLUE applications. Following these guidelines will help you create maintainable, efficient, and scalable AI systems.

## 1. Application Structure

### Organization

```glue
// 1. App configuration
glue app {
    name = "My App"
    config { ... } // sticky = true for global app persistence between runs, development = true for verbose logging
}

// 2. Tool definitions
tool web_search {
    provider = // built-in: serp, tavily.. or configure a custom web search provider in the cli 
}

tool file_handler {
    

// 3. Model definitions
model researcher { ... }
model assistant { ... }

// 4. Team structure
magnetize {
    team1 { ... }
    team2 { ... }
    
    flow { ... }
}

apply glue
```

### Best Practices
- Group related components together
- Use clear, descriptive names
- Keep files focused and organized
- Follow consistent comment style:
  ```glue
  // 1. Use // for all comments
  // 2. Place each comment on its own line
  // 3. Align related comments for readability
  glue app {
      name = "MyApp"          // Short inline comments are OK
      config {
          development = true   // Explain non-obvious settings
          sticky = true       // Especially configuration options
      }
  }
  
  // 4. Use comments to separate major sections
  // 5. Explain complex configurations
  // 6. Document important decisions
  ```

## 2. Model Design

### Role Definition
```glue
model researcher {
    provider = openrouter
    role = "Research topics thoroughly and methodically."  // Clear, focused role
    adhesives = [glue, velcro]  // Only what's needed
    config {
        model = "meta-llama/Llama-3.1-70b-instruct:free"  // Clear model choice
        temperature = 0.7  // Higher for creative tasks
    }
}

model fact_checker {
    provider = openrouter
    role = "Verify facts with high accuracy."  // Single responsibility
    adhesives = [tape]  // Quick, stateless checks
    config {
        model = "meta-llama/Llama-3.1-70b-instruct:free"  // Same model
        temperature = 0.2  // Lower for accuracy
    }
}
```

### Best Practices

1. Roles

   - Give each model a clear, single responsibility
   - Write specific, actionable role descriptions
   - Avoid overlapping responsibilities

2. Adhesives

   - Only enable needed adhesive types
   - Use GLUE for team-wide knowledge
   - Use VELCRO for session state
   - Use TAPE for verification tasks

3. Configuration

   - Use the best model for the task
   - Match temperature to task type
   - Higher (0.7-0.9) for creative tasks
   - Lower (0.1-0.3) for factual tasks
   - Medium (0.4-0.6) for balanced tasks

## 3. Team Organization

### Structure
```glue
magnetize {
    // Research team with persistent results
    research {
        lead = researcher      // Strong lead for direction
        members = [assistant]  // Support roles
        tools = [web_search]   // Essential tools only
    }
    
    // Verification team with quick checks
    verify {
        lead = fact_checker    // Accuracy-focused lead
        tools = [web_search]   // Same tool, different usage
    }
    
    flow {
        research -> verify  // Clear information flow
    }
}
```

### Best Practices
1. Team Composition
   - Choose appropriate team leads
   - Balance team capabilities
   - Keep teams focused on goals
   - Minimize team size for efficiency

2. Tool Assignment
   - Give teams only needed tools
   - Consider tool usage patterns
   - Match tools to team goals
   - Share tools appropriately

3. Information Flow
   - Design clear flow patterns
   - Use push for regular updates
   - Use pull for on-demand data
   - Avoid circular dependencies

## 4. Tool Usage

### Configuration
```glue
// Simple tool with defaults
tool file_handler {}

// Configured tool with provider
tool web_search {
    provider = serp  // Clear provider choice
}

// Complex tool with specific config
tool code_interpreter {
    config {
        languages = ["python"]  // Only what's needed
        sandbox = true         // Safety first
        timeout = 30          // Reasonable limits
    }
}
```

### Best Practices
1. Tool Selection
   - Choose appropriate tools for tasks
   - Use built-in tools when possible
   - Create custom tools when needed
   - Keep tool configurations simple

2. Resource Management
   - Set appropriate timeouts
   - Enable caching when beneficial
   - Clean up resources properly
   - Monitor tool usage

3. Security
   - Enable sandbox mode for code
   - Validate tool inputs
   - Handle errors gracefully
   - Protect sensitive data

## 5. Communication Patterns

### Team Communication
```glue
magnetize {
    team1 {
        lead = model1
        members = [model2, model3]  // Clear team structure
    }
    
    team2 {
        lead = model4
    }
    
    flow {
        team1 -> team2   // Explicit flow
        team2 <- pull    // Clear pull access
    }
}
```

### Best Practices
1. Internal Communication
   - Let team members chat freely
   - Share results appropriately
   - Maintain clear roles
   - Use team leads effectively

2. External Communication
   - Define clear flow patterns
   - Use push for regular updates
   - Use pull for specific needs
   - Avoid unnecessary sharing

3. Result Sharing
   - Use GLUE for team knowledge
   - Use VELCRO for session data
   - Use TAPE for verification
   - Clean up old results

## 6. Error Handling

### Best Practices
1. Tool Errors
   - Handle API failures gracefully
   - Provide clear error messages
   - Implement retry logic
   - Log errors appropriately

2. Model Errors
   - Validate model outputs
   - Handle timeout errors
   - Provide fallback options
   - Monitor model performance

3. Flow Errors
   - Handle missing data
   - Validate team interactions
   - Provide error recovery
   - Maintain system state

## 7. Performance
