# GLUE Framework Documentation

## Context-Aware System

### Overview
GLUE features an intelligent context-aware system that automatically adapts to different types of interactions. Whether you're having a simple chat or doing complex research, GLUE naturally adjusts its behavior without requiring any special configuration.

### Key Features
- Natural conversation handling
- Smart tool usage (only when needed)
- Automatic role adaptation
- Learning from interactions

### Basic Usage

#### 1. Simple Conversations
```python
# GLUE automatically handles simple chats without unnecessary tool use
response = await conversation.process(
    models=models,
    user_input="Hello, how are you?"
)
```

#### 2. Research Tasks
```python
# GLUE automatically enables relevant tools for research
response = await conversation.process(
    models=models,
    user_input="Research quantum computing"
)
```

#### 3. Document Creation
```python
# GLUE intelligently combines tools as needed
response = await conversation.process(
    models=models,
    user_input="Create a summary of recent AI developments"
)
```

### Smart Features

#### 1. Natural Tool Usage
- Tools are only used when they make sense
- No tool usage for simple conversations
- Automatic tool selection for research/tasks
- Smooth transitions between modes

Example:
```python
# These happen automatically:
"Hello" -> Direct response
"Search quantum physics" -> Uses web_search
"Save this as notes.md" -> Uses file_handler
```

#### 2. Adaptive Behavior
- Adjusts to conversation style
- Remembers successful patterns
- Improves over time
- Maintains conversation flow

Example:
```python
# Natural flow in mixed interactions
responses = await conversation.process_many([
    "Hi there",                    # Chat mode
    "Research quantum computing",  # Research mode
    "Save that as a report",      # Task mode
    "Thanks!"                     # Back to chat mode
])
```

#### 3. Learning System
- Learns from successful interactions
- Adapts to user preferences
- Remembers useful patterns
- Improves tool usage

Example:
```python
# GLUE learns and adapts automatically
for task in research_tasks:
    response = await conversation.process(
        models=models,
        user_input=task
    )
    # Each interaction improves future responses
```

### Best Practices

1. Natural Interactions
   - Write requests naturally
   - Let GLUE handle tool selection
   - Trust the context awareness
   - No need to specify modes

2. Complex Tasks
   - Describe what you want
   - Let GLUE figure out the tools
   - Chain operations happen automatically
   - Results combine seamlessly

3. Mixed Usage
   - Switch between modes freely
   - No need to reset or reconfigure
   - Natural conversation flow
   - Automatic adaptation

### Examples

#### Research Assistant
```python
# GLUE handles the complexity automatically
response = await conversation.process(
    models=models,
    user_input="""
    Research the latest developments in quantum computing,
    focus on practical applications, and create a summary
    report with key findings.
    """
)
```

#### Document Creation
```python
# GLUE manages tool coordination automatically
response = await conversation.process(
    models=models,
    user_input="""
    Create a report about renewable energy trends,
    include recent statistics, and format it in markdown.
    """
)
```

#### Interactive Session
```python
# Natural flow between different modes
responses = await conversation.process_many([
    "Hi, can you help me with some research?",
    "I need to learn about machine learning",
    "That's interesting, can you save these points?",
    "Great, now summarize what we learned",
    "Thanks for your help!"
])
```

### Advanced Features

#### 1. Memory Integration
- Conversations maintain context
- Previous research is remembered
- Patterns improve over time
- Natural reference to past items

#### 2. Tool Coordination
- Tools work together seamlessly
- Results combine naturally
- Context flows between tools
- Smooth transitions

#### 3. Role Adaptation
- Models adjust to tasks
- Expertise applied appropriately
- Natural collaboration
- Smooth handoffs

### Error Handling
GLUE handles errors gracefully and maintains conversation flow:

```python
try:
    response = await conversation.process(
        models=models,
        user_input="Research quantum computing"
    )
except Exception as e:
    # GLUE handles errors gracefully
    print(f"Something went wrong: {e}")
```
