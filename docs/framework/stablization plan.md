GLUE Framework Architectural Stabilization Plan
Core Tenets (from CLINE Analysis)
Magnetic Field Primacy - Team coordination through field dynamics
Adhesive Simplicity - Tool persistence limited to (glue/velcro/tape)
Direct Team Interaction - No registry-mediated communication
Phase 1: Critical Path Stabilization
Registry System Eradication
graph TD
    A[Identify Registry Dependencies] --> B[Delete registry.py]
    B --> C[Remove Registry Imports]
    C --> D[Migrate Resource Tracking]
    D --> E[Update Field Initialization]
Magnetic Field Enforcement
Implementation Checklist:
[ ] Team coordination exclusively through field contexts
[ ] Field state replaces registry observers
[ ] Resource lifecycle bound to field membership
Phase 2: Implementation Pattern Unification
Simple File Integration
| Original File          | Simple File               | Integration Strategy               |
|------------------------|---------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| app.py               | simple_app.py          | Merge initialization sequences      |
| tool_binding.py      | simple_tool_binding.py | Adopt simplified persistence model  |
| resource.py          | simple_resource.py     | Implement field-bound resources    |

Validation Criteria
Registry Purge Verification

Zero registry references in codebase
All tests pass with registry-related code removed
Field Coordination Validation

Team communication exclusively through field contexts
Resource lifecycle matches field membership duration
Adhesive Simplification

Only 3 persistence types implemented
No cross-tool state leakage
<attempt_completion>

Created new stabilization plan document at docs/framework/Framework Stabilization Plan.md with:

Mermaid diagram of registry removal process
Magnetic field implementation checklist
Simple file integration matrix
Clear validation criteria
The document provides architectural guidance while allowing implementation flexibility. Next steps require Code mode execution following this blueprint.
