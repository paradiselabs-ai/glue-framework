# GLUE Binding System

The GLUE binding system provides a flexible way to define how models and tools interact, using intuitive adhesive metaphors to describe different types of connections.

## Binding Strengths

### TAPE: Temporary Bindings

- Quick, one-time operations
- Breaks after use
- No context persistence
- Perfect for:
  - Quick fact verification
  - Single lookups
  - One-time tool usage

### VELCRO: Flexible Bindings

- Can disconnect/reconnect
- Maintains some context
- Good for:
  - Iterative development
  - Tool chains that need flexibility
  - Models that work independently but share context

### GLUE: Persistent Bindings

- Strong, lasting connections
- Full context persistence
- Ideal for:
  - Core model relationships
  - Long-running research context
  - Critical tool integrations

## Usage in GLUE DSL

### 1. Tool Configuration in Models

```glue
model researcher {
    tools {
        web_search = glue      // Persistent search context
        code_gen = velcro      // Flexible code generation
    }
}

model writer {
    tools {
        web_search = tape      // Quick fact checking
    }
}
```

### 2. Model Relationships in Workflow

```glue
workflow {
    // Persistent collaboration
    researcher >< assistant | glue
    
    // Flexible tool usage
    assistant >< code_gen | velcro
    
    // Quick verification
    writer >< web_search | tape
}
```

## Implementation Details

### Resource System Integration

```python
# Define tool binding
model.bind_tool("web_search", BindingStrength.GLUE)

# Use tool with binding rules
result = await model.use_tool("web_search", query="quantum computing")
```

### Binding Behaviors

1. TAPE Binding:

   ```python
   # Breaks after use
   await model.use_tool("web_search")  # Tool used
   assert not model.is_bound_to("web_search")  # Binding broken
   ```

2. VELCRO Binding:

   ```python
   # Can reconnect
   await model.use_tool("code_gen")  # First use
   await model.use_tool("code_gen")  # Can use again
   assert model.is_bound_to("code_gen")  # Still bound
   ```

3. GLUE Binding:

   ```python
   # Maintains context
   result1 = await model.use_tool("web_search")
   result2 = await model.use_tool("web_search")  # Has context from result1
   assert model.get_tool_context("web_search")  # Persistent context
   ```

## Best Practices

1. Choose Binding Strength Based on Need:
   - Use TAPE for verification and quick lookups
   - Use VELCRO for flexible, iterative work
   - Use GLUE for core functionality and context

2. Model-Tool Relationships:
   - Consider how models use tools
   - Match binding strength to usage pattern
   - Think about context requirements

3. Model-Model Relationships:
   - Use GLUE for core collaborations
   - Use VELCRO for flexible teamwork
   - Consider data flow patterns

4. Context Management:
   - TAPE: No context to manage
   - VELCRO: Light context, can reset
   - GLUE: Full context persistence

## Examples

### Research Assistant

```glue
// Primary researcher with persistent search
model researcher {
    tools {
        web_search = glue  // Maintains research context
    }
}

// Assistant with flexible tool usage
model assistant {
    tools {
        web_search = velcro  // Can search as needed
        code_gen = velcro    // Flexible code generation
    }
}

// Writer with quick verification
model writer {
    tools {
        web_search = tape  // Quick fact checking
    }
}

workflow {
    // Core research relationship
    researcher >< assistant | glue
    
    // Information flow
    assistant -> writer
    writer <- assistant
}
```

### Benefits

1. Natural Workflow:
   - Binding strengths match natural work patterns
   - Clear intent in configuration
   - Intuitive behavior

2. Efficient Resource Use:
   - No unnecessary context maintenance
   - Clean breaks when appropriate
   - Flexible reconnection when needed

3. Clear Patterns:
   - Explicit relationship types
   - Self-documenting configurations
   - Easy to understand and modify
