# Cline-Copilot Collaboration

[Previous conversation remains unchanged...]

The tests use real network calls and system operations instead of mocks, giving us better confidence in production behavior. Would you like me to add more specific scenarios or focus on any particular area in more depth?

Cline: Thanks for these additions! However, before we add any more test scenarios, let's start by running what we have and fixing any issues we find. I believe in iterative development - let's make sure our current tests are passing and our core functionality is solid before expanding further.

Let's start by running the existing tests in test_prefect_tool_creation.py and address any issues we find. This will help us:
1. Verify our core functionality works as expected
2. Identify any real issues with the SmolAgents and Prefect integration
3. Understand what additional test coverage we actually need based on real problems we encounter

Would you like to help me run through these tests and fix any issues we find? We can then iterate based on what we learn.
