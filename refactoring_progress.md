# GLUE Framework Refactoring Progress Report

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Dependency Updates
- Removed redis dependency in favor of Mem0
- Added mem0ai>=0.1.49 (latest version) for semantic memory
- Added qdrant-client>=1.7.0 for vector storage
- All dependencies are now properly versioned in pyproject.toml

### 2. Code Improvements
- Removed ToolPermission system in favor of team-based magnetic field access control
  - Removed from file_handler.py
  - Removed from web_search.py
  - Removed from code_interpreter.py
- Added proper Pydantic type annotations to all tool classes
  - Added type hints for class attributes in BaseTool
  - Added type hints for class attributes in FileHandlerTool
  - Added type hints for class attributes in WebSearchTool
  - Added type hints for class attributes in CodeInterpreterTool

### 3. Test Infrastructure
- Created comprehensive Mem0 integration tests (test_mem0_integration.py)
  - Tests basic store/retrieve operations
  - Tests semantic search functionality
  - Tests shared memory operations
  - Tests memory expiration
  - Tests memory with context
  - Tests memory cleanup

## In Progress

### 1. Test Execution
- Need to run and verify all Mem0 integration tests
- Need to ensure all existing tests pass with the new changes
- Need to verify test coverage for new memory functionality

### 2. Documentation
- Need to update documentation to reflect removal of ToolPermission system
- Need to add documentation for Mem0 integration
- Need to document team-based access control through magnetic fields

## Next Steps

### 1. Critical Path Components
- Verify core features are working:
  - Team collaboration
  - Adhesive bindings
  - Magnetic flows
  - Tool usage

### 2. Error Handling
- Implement structured error handling approach
- Create base exception class
- Use decorators for tool execution error wrapping
- Centralize error handling

### 3. Memory and Resource Management
- Complete Mem0 integration testing
- Verify memory persistence across sessions
- Test memory cleanup and resource management
- Implement memory limits and quotas

### 4. Documentation and Examples
- Update documentation for new architecture
- Create example applications
- Add migration guide for existing users
- Document best practices

## Known Issues

1. Pylance showing false positive errors in memory.py:
   - "{" was not closed
   - Positional argument after keyword arguments
   - "(" was not closed
   These appear to be IDE issues rather than actual syntax errors.

2. Need to verify all tools are properly using the new team-based access control system instead of ToolPermission.

## Recommendations

1. **Testing Priority**
   - Focus on running and fixing the Mem0 integration tests first
   - Then run the full test suite to catch any regressions
   - Add more test cases for team-based access control

2. **Documentation**
   - Update all documentation to reflect the new architecture
   - Add examples of using team-based access control
   - Document Mem0 configuration and usage

3. **Code Quality**
   - Run type checking across the entire codebase
   - Ensure consistent use of type annotations
   - Verify all Pydantic models are properly configured

4. **Performance**
   - Profile memory usage with Mem0
   - Test semantic search performance
   - Verify resource cleanup

## Next Developer Tasks

1. Run and fix any failing tests:
```bash
pytest tests/core/test_mem0_integration.py -v
pytest tests/ -v  # Full test suite
```

2. Review and update documentation:
   - Check docs/ directory for outdated references to ToolPermission
   - Update examples to use team-based access control
   - Add Mem0 configuration guide

3. Verify type checking:
```bash
mypy src/
```

##  Future CI/CD Implementation (After Framework Stabilization):
   - Plan GitHub Actions configuration
   - Define test coverage requirements
   - Design deployment strategy
   
Note: CI/CD implementation has been deprioritized until after the framework's core functionality is stable and all tests are passing. This will prevent false negatives in the CI pipeline during the architectural transition.

Remember to maintain the focus on team-based organization and magnetic field interactions as the primary means of access control and communication between components.

# Note:

I have put examples/  and docs/framework/ back out of gitignore. there should only be two files in examples/ and one is research_assistant.glue which has the most up to date glue syntax. all other example apps have been deleted
