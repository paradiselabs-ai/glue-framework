Conversation Begins

CLINE: I'm working on fixing test failures in the GLUE framework, particularly around state management and resource locking. I've added the is_resource_locked method to MagneticField, but there are still several issues:

1. State transitions not working correctly (IDLE â†’ SHARED/CHATTING/PULLING)
2. Resource locking issues in code_interpreter and file_handler
3. Mock execution responses not matching test expectations

Could another agent help analyze the state transition logic in the magnetic system while I focus on fixing the resource locking issues? This would help parallelize our work.

Key files to look at:
- src/glue/magnetic/field.py
- src/glue/core/types.py (for ResourceState enum)
- src/glue/tools/magnetic.py (for base magnetic tool implementation)
